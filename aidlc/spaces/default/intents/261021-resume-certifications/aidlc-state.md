# AI-DLC State Tracking

## Project Information
- **Project**: Update the résumé certifications. Keep OPIc IH with issue date 2025-09-06 and expiry 2027-09-06. Remove the expired 新HSK 6급. Add AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate, issued 2026-07-17, expiring 2029-07-17, in a new separate 자격증 section, keeping 어학 자격 for language certificates. Show exact day-precision dates (issue to expiry), which the profile date types do not support yet. Facts need a new fact inventory revision and approval receipt, and a new PDF candidate.
